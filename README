This is a fork of CoffeeScript that exists purely for
explorational purposes for features that don't really
fit CoffeeScript.

I'm not affiliated with jashkenas or the core
CoffeeScript team.

Here are some features:

Pattern Matching.

      fac =
        (0) -> 1
        (1) -> 1
        (n) -> n * fac(n - 1)

This is desugared into a bunch of ifs. You can use
strings, integers, named parameters and a _ (wildcard)
so far. 

Here's the commit. It's quite simple:

Arrows.

    a = 1
    b <- f(b)
    c = b * 10
    d <- f(c)
    d

This is just sugar for a bunch of nested callbacks:

    var a = 1;
    f(a, function(b) {
      var c = b * 10;
      f(c, function(d) {
        return d;
      });
    });

TODO:

 - Erlang-style destructuring should be easy.
 - Optimize on the generated pattern-matching code.
 - Add some way to help handling errors. Simple
   stuff such as `?.` that makes life better.

  CoffeeScript is a little language that compiles into JavaScript.

  Install Node.js, and then the CoffeeScript compiler:
  sudo bin/cake install

  Or, if you have the Node Package Manager installed:
  npm install -g coffee-script
  (Leave off the -g if you don't wish to install globally.)

  Execute a script:
  coffee /path/to/script.coffee

  Compile a script:
  coffee -c /path/to/script.coffee

  For documentation, usage, and examples, see:
  http://coffeescript.org/
